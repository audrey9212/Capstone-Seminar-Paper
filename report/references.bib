  abstract = {Abstract                            Ensemble learning involves using several individual classifiers and combining their predictions, which may result in better performance than a single classifier. This article proposes a two‐layer flexible voting ensemble model to predict the customer churn rates in the telecommunication industries. The datasets used in this study are from IBM Sample Data Sets and Duke University. Following the pre‐processing stage, the datasets have been categorized into an imbalanced and a balanced set. The balanced set comprises of an equal number of instances for both classes (‘churn’ and ‘not churn’). Extensive investigations were also carried out to determine the circumstances under which the model provides the best performance. The results of the hybrid algorithm with the IBM imbalanced dataset give an accuracy of 82.30\% and an               F               1‐score of 63\%. However, with the IBM balanced dataset, an accuracy of 76.20\% and an               F               1‐score of 77.06\% are obtained. When considering the dataset from Duke University an accuracy of 71.33\% and an               F               1‐score of 14.3\% are obtained with the imbalanced dataset. The proposed model provides an accuracy of 60.41\% and an               F               1‐score of 64.13\% with the corresponding balanced dataset. Test work results indicate that the approach adopted has significantly increased the               F               1‐score of the classification when considering a balanced dataset in both cases. Additionally,               p               ‐values of less than 0.05 indicate that the results obtained with IBM imbalanced dataset and both balanced and imbalanced dataset from Duke University are statistically significant.},

Therefore it is essential to efficiently retain gamblers. Churn prediction is a promising new alternative in customer relationship management (CRM) to analyze customer retention. It is the process of identifying gamblers with a high probability to leave the company based on their past behavior. This study investigates whether churn prediction is a valuable option in the CRM palette of the online gambling companies. Using real-life data of poker players at bwin, single algorithms, CART decision trees and generalized additive models are benchmarked to their ensemble counterparts, random forests and GAMens. The results show that churn prediction is a valuable strategy to identify and profile those customers at risk. Furthermore, the performance of the ensembles is more robust and better than the single models.},

Therefore, drawing on a sample of 684 residential customers of digital cellular network operators in Germany this study tests hypotheses suggesting that CR, CL, and CS should be treated as differential constructs which are causally inter-linked. LISREL analyses support a two-staged model in which overall CS has a significant impact on CL which in turn influences a customer's intention to terminate/extend the contractual relationship with his mobile cellular network operator (=CR). Mobile service price and personal service benefit perceptions as well as (lack of) number portability between various cellular operators were identified as supply-related variables with the strongest effects on CR. Mobile network operators’ perceived customer care performance had no significant impact on CR. The findings suggest that an important lever for regulators to promote competition in cellular markets is the enforcement of efficient number portability procedures between mobile network operators.},

A generalization of classical survival analysis methods is used to examine the risk of losing a customer once an initial insurance policy cancellation has occurred. This method does not assume that the model parameters are fixed over time, but rather that the parameters may fluctuate. Our results suggest that the kind of contracts held by customers and the concurrence of an external competitor strongly influence customer loyalty right after that cancellation, but those factors become much less significant some months later. Our study shows how predictions of the probability of losing a customer can be readjusted and improves the way companies manage business risk.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, there is no shortage of options for customers when choosing where to put their money. As a result, customer churn and engagement have become one of the top issues. With the increase in the number of service providers for the same targeted population, there is a need for service providers to try to find the changing customer behaviour and their rising expectations to retain them. Various studies have proposed customer churn. Data mining was routinely used to predict telecom customer attrition. Most researchers have compared and proposed different approaches for the prediction of customer churn, though some of the Machine learning (ML) algorithms used were unable to provide the performance needed to identify customer churn. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) in the Telecommunications Dataset. To prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms, chi-square was used for feature selection to select the most informative features from the original dataset. We validate our model using a ten-fold cross-validation approach to test the performance of our models. RF model performed better than other models in terms of accuracy (94\%), precision (94\%) and F-measure (94\%), respectively. Additionally, we compared our results with existing models that used the same dataset; the proposed strategy outperformed them.

This shows that accuracy of ensemble algorithms is still very advantageous in terms of predictive classification. The main task of this article is to predict the loss of telecom customers. Under the current situation of saturation of the telecom market, how to retain the original customers is the main task of each telecom operator. This article mainly compares the four prediction models on the telecom data set. Predictive performance, the final performance evaluation index also shows that the random forest model and XGBoost model of integrated thought have better predictive models.},

In order to further demonstrate the proposed approach's capability, a real-world problem of the fright transport industry market segmentation is employed.

Marketing theory suggests that consumers use information sources in a distinctive way to reduce the uncertainty associated with services. Hence, six hypotheses are developed to test the information acquisition of service buyers. An experimental approach is employed to compare, in a prepurchase context, the information sources used by consumers of services and those used by consumers of goods. The resulting data support the predictions offered and extend marketing theory.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this study, we explore the possible factors affecting churn in the Danish telecommunication industry and how those factors connect with retention strategies. The Danish telecommunication industry is experiencing a saturated market regarding the number of customers, but the number of service providers has increased significantly in recent years. Due to the high costs of acquiring new customers, the telecommunication industry put great emphasis on retaining customers in such an intensely competitive industry. We employ five machine learning algorithms: random forest, AdaBoost, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting classifier, and decision tree classifier on four datasets from two geographical regions, Denmark and the USA. The first three datasets are from online repositories, and the last one contains responses from 311 students from Aalborg University collected through a survey. We identify key features extracted by the best-performing algorithms based on five performance measures. Based on that, we aggregate all the features that appear important for each dataset. The results demonstrate that customers’ preferences are not aligned. Among the prominent drivers, we find that service quality, customer satisfaction, offering subscription plan upgrades, and network coverage are unique to the Danish student population. Telecommunication companies need to integrate the sociohistoric milieu of the Nordic countries to tailor their retention policies to different consumer cultures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Customer churn remains a critical concern for businesses, highlighting the significance of retaining existing customers over acquiring new ones. Effective prediction of potential churners aids in devising robust retention policies and efficient customer management strategies. This study dives into the realm of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis in churn prediction, addressing the inherent challenge posed by diverse and imbalanced customer churn data distributions. This paper introduces a novel approach—the Ratio-based data balancing technique, which addresses data skewness as a pre-processing step, ensuring improved accuracy in predictive modelling. This study fills gaps in existing literature by highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble algorithms and the critical role of data balancing techniques in optimizing churn prediction models. While our research contributes a novel approach, there remain avenues for further exploration. This work evaluates several machine learning algorithms—Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, alongside Ensemble techniques such as Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—on balanced datasets achieved through our proposed Ratio-based data balancing technique and the commonly used Data Resampling. Results reveal that our proposed Ratio-based data balancing technique notably outperforms traditional Over-Sampling and Under-Sampling methods in churn prediction accuracy. Additionally, using combined algorithms like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost showed better results than using single methods. Our study looked at different aspects like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-Score, finding that these combined methods are better for predicting customer churn. Specifically, when we used a 75:25 ratio with the XGBoost method, we got the most promising results for our analysis which are presented in this work.},

This paper investigates the effects of interpersonal influence on the accuracy of customer churn predictions and proposes a novel prediction model that is based on interpersonal influence and that combines the propagation process and customers’ personalized characters. Our contributions include the following: (1) the effects of interpersonal influence on prediction accuracy are evaluated while including determinants that other researchers proved effective, and several models are constructed based on machine learning and statistical methods and compared, assuring the validity of the evaluation; and (2) a novel prediction model based on interpersonal influence and information propagation is proposed. The dataset used in the empirical study was obtained from a leading mobile telecommunication service provider and contains the traditional and network attributes of over one million customers. The empirical results show that traditional classification models that incorporate interpersonal influence can greatly improve prediction accuracy, and our proposed prediction model outperforms the traditional models.},
