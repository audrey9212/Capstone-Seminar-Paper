  abstract = {Without proper analysis and forecasting, industries will find themselves repeatedly churning customers, which the telecom industry in particular cannot afford. A predictable model for customers will allow companies to retain current customers and to obtain new ones. Deep-BP-ANN implemented in this study using two feature selection methods, Variance Thresholding and Lasso Regression, in addition, our model strengthened by early stopping technique to stop training at right time and prevent overfitting. We compared the efficiency of minimizing overfitting between dropout and activity regularization strategies for two real datasets: IBM Telco and Cell2cell. Different evaluation approaches used: Holdout, and 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's efficiency. To solve unbalanced issue, the Random Oversampling technique was used to balance both datasets. The results show that the model implemented performs well with lasso regression for feature selection, early stopping technique to pick the epochs, and large numbers of neurons (250) into the input and hidden layers, and activity regularization to minimize overfitting for both datasets. In predicting customer churn, our findings outperform ML techniques: XG\_Boost, Logistic\_Regression, Na\"ive\_Bayes, and KNN. Moreover, our Deep-BP-ANN model's accuracy outperforms the existing deep learning techniques that use holdout or 10fold CV for the same datasets.},

  abstract = {This research examines the customer churn issues in the telecommunications industry, which significantly impact companies by leading to revenue loss and high costs associated with acquiring new customers. Therefore, effective prediction and preventing churn are still significant challenges in the industry. This research utilises deep learning techniques to implement a model that can predict customer churn. The dataset used is the "Customer Churn Prediction" dataset from Kaggle, which contains 100,000 customer records with 100 features, including demographic information, service usage patterns, billing details, and customer behaviour metrics collected over a 12-month period from a major telecommunications provider. Moreover, the Genetic Algorithm is used as a feature selection technique to find the best features from the dataset and help to improve the model's performance. The most crucial factors that impact churn, such as customer usage patterns, network quality, and engagement with customer care, were identified. Moreover, the implemented Deep Learning model, Temporal Convolutional Network, used train and test data to calculate several metrics. Hyperparameters for TCN are used to improve model performance. The results are an accuracy of 70.4\%, a sensitivity of 71\%, and an AUC of 0.8. These results outperform the single models, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forests (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\"ive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The suggested model helps telecom companies keep their customers and reduce churn rates by providing a practical solution.},

This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the strategic integration of AI into financial product management, proposing a multidimensional framework that addresses data infrastructure, model development, governance, customer-centric design, and cross-functional roles. Grounded in contemporary research and informed by a realworld case study, the study identifies how financial institutions can transition from experimental adoption to enterprise-wide deployment by embedding AI across the product lifecycle. Through strategic engagement with rising technologies such as generative AI and federated learning, this paper evaluates both the transformative potential and systemic risks associated with AI-native products. Ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, regulatory hurdles, and talent readiness are analyzed as important constraints requiring active oversight and limitation strategies. The proposed operational model offers guiding principles for organizations seeking to align innovation with compliance and stakeholder trust. The findings affirm that the strategic value of AI lies both in automation, efficiency, and also its capacity to inform adaptive, inclusive, and forward-looking product leadership in financial services.},

  abstract = {Retaining customers is one of the most critical challenges in the maturing mobile telecommunications service industry. Using customer transaction and billing data, this study investigates determinants of customer churn in the Korean mobile telecommunications service market. Results indicate that call quality-related factors influence customer churn; however, customers participating in membership card programs are also more likely to churn, which raises questions about program effectiveness. Furthermore, heavy users also tend to churn. In order to analyze partial and total defection, this study defines changes in a customer's status from active use (using the service on a regular basis) to non-use (deciding not to use it temporarily without having churned yet) or suspended (being suspended by the service provider) as partial defection and from active use to churn as total defection. Thus, mediating effects of a customer's partial defection on the relationship between the churn determinants and total defection are analyzed and their implications are discussed. Results indicate that some churn determinants influence customer churn, either directly or indirectly through a customer's status change, or both; therefore, a customer's status change explains the relationship between churn determinants and the probability of churn.},

  abstract = {The most commonly reported model evaluation metric is the accuracy. This metric can be misleading when the data are imbalanced. In such cases, other evaluation metrics should be considered in addition to the accuracy. This study reviews alternative evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of a model in highly imbalanced data. We used credit card clients in Taiwan as a case study. The data set contains 30,000 instances (22.12\% risky and 77.88\% non-risky) assessing the likeliness of a customer defaulting on a payment. Three different techniques were used during the model building process. The first technique involved down-sampling the majority class in the training subset. The second used the original imbalanced data whereas prior probabilities were set to account for oversampling in the third technique. The same sets of predictive models were then built for each technique after which the evaluation metrics were computed. The results suggest that model evaluation metrics might reveal more about distribution of classes than they do about the actual performance of models when the data are imbalanced. Moreover, some of the predictive models were identified to be very sensitive to imbalance. The final decision in model selection should consider a combination of different measures instead of relying on one measure. To minimize imbalance-biased estimates of performance, we recommend reporting both the obtained metric values and the degree of imbalance in the data. INTRODUCTION One of the biggest challenges in data mining is dealing with highly imbalanced data sets. We encounter imbalanced data in several real world applications including, credit card fraud detection, churn prediction, customer retention, and medical diagnostics among many others. An imbalance occurs when one or more classes (minority class) have very low proportions in the data as compared to the other classes (majority class). Mostly in these situations, the main interest is in correctly classifying the minority class. However, the most commonly used classification algorithms do not work well for such problems. This is because the classifiers tend to be biased towards the majority class and hence perform poorly on the minority class. Several different techniques have been proposed to solve the problems associated with learning from class-imbalanced data. One of such techniques is based on cost sensitive learning. Here, a high cost is assigned to misclassification of the minority class while trying to minimize the overall cost. For instance, an analyst might have reasons to believe that misclassifying the minority class (false negatives) is X times costlier than misclassifying the majority class (false positives). The addition of specific costs during model training will bias the model towards the minority class thereby affecting the model parameters. This therefore has a potential of improving upon the performance of the model. Another technique is to use a sampling technique during model training: either down-sample the majority class or over-sample the minority class. Down-sampling is a technique utilized to reduce the number of samples in the majority class to obtain roughly equal data points across the classes. Up-sampling on the other hand simulates data points to enhance balance across the classes. Even though the use of sampling techniques can introduce bias into the model results, these techniques can still be effective during the tuning of model parameters. Despite the improvements of the above techniques on model performance during parameter tuning, we note that the best performing model is not chosen based on the performance measure of the training subset but on the testing subset. The distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. In addition, the testing data needs to be consistent and reflect the state of nature of the real data in order to produce honest estimates of future events. Consequently, sampling techniques cannot be applied to the testing data to fairly balance the class distribution. In such situations, it is the duty of the researcher or practitioner to determine an appropriate performance measure to use when choosing between different classifiers.},

  abstract = {Customer churn remains a critical challenge in telecommunications, necessitating effective churn prediction (CP) methodologies. This paper introduces the Enhanced Gradient Boosting Model (EGBM), which uses a Support Vector Machine with a Radial Basis Function kernel (SVMRBF) as a base learner and exponential loss function to enhance the learning process of the GBM. The novel base learner significantly improves the initial classification performance of the traditional GBM and achieves enhanced performance in CP-EGBM after multiple boosting stages by utilizing state-of-the-art decision tree learners. Further, a modified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using the consumption operator of the Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) method to prevent premature convergence of the PSO in the local optima is developed to tune the hyper-parameters of the CP-EGBM effectively. Seven open-source CP datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the developed CP-EGBM model using several quantitative evaluation metrics. The results showed that the CP-EGBM is significantly better than GBM and SVM models. Results are statistically validated using the Friedman ranking test. The proposed CP-EGBM is also compared with recently reported models in the literature. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models showcases CP-EGBM's promising improvements, making it a robust and effective solution for churn prediction in the telecommunications industry.},

This article proposes a unique approach for accurate churn prediction: recurrent neural networks (RNNs) plus attention mechanisms. By taking advantage of the temporal dependencies found in subscription-based interactions, the RNN model dynamically learns and concentrates on important features. This enables it to detect minute patterns that can point to potential churn behavior in the future. This study thoroughly examines churn characteristics in e-commerce subscription services in order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed RNN architecture in anticipating client attrition. Experiments on real datasets show that the model works better than traditional methods, achieving notable accuracy and predictive power. Moreover, the attention processes in the model allow it to rank the informative traits in order of importance, providing insight into the fundamental causes of customer attrition. The results of this study establish a solid framework for proactive churn control and long-term growth, which has important ramifications for e-commerce companies. Businesses may maximize resource allocation, raise customer happiness, and develop enduring connections with their subscribers by utilizing the predictive powers of RNNs with attention mechanisms. Python is used to implement the suggested work. The accuracy of the suggested study is 9 7 \%.},

While there is a vast literature on developing chum prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of chuming, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of chuming are not necessarily the best targets for proactive chum programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of chuming. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of chuming. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.},

This article proposes a two-layer flexible voting ensemble model to predict the customer churn rates in the telecommunication industries. The datasets used in this study are from IBM Sample Data Sets and Duke University. Following the pre-processing stage, the datasets have been categorized into an imbalanced and a balanced set. The balanced set comprises of an equal number of instances for both classes (`churn' and `not churn'). Extensive investigations were also carried out to determine the circumstances under which the model provides the best performance. The results of the hybrid algorithm with the IBM imbalanced dataset give an accuracy of 82.30\% and an               F               1-score of 63\%. However, with the IBM balanced dataset, an accuracy of 76.20\% and an               F               1-score of 77.06\% are obtained. When considering the dataset from Duke University an accuracy of 71.33\% and an               F               1-score of 14.3\% are obtained with the imbalanced dataset. The proposed model provides an accuracy of 60.41\% and an               F               1-score of 64.13\% with the corresponding balanced dataset. Test work results indicate that the approach adopted has significantly increased the               F               1-score of the classification when considering a balanced dataset in both cases. Additionally,               p               -values of less than 0.05 indicate that the results obtained with IBM imbalanced dataset and both balanced and imbalanced dataset from Duke University are statistically significant.},

Despite the popularity and accuracy of heterogeneous ensembles in various domains, customer churn prediction models have not yet been picked up. Moreover, there are other developments in the performance evaluation and model comparison level that have not been introduced in a systematic way. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a large scale benchmark study in customer churn prediction implementing these novel methods. To do so, we benchmark 33 classifiers, including 6 single classifiers, 14 homogeneous, and 13 heterogeneous ensembles across 11 datasets. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous ensembles are consistently ranked higher than homogeneous ensembles and single classifiers. It is observed that a heterogeneous ensemble with simulated annealing classifier selection is ranked the highest in terms of AUC and expected maximum profits. For accuracy, F1 measure and top-decile lift, a heterogenous ensemble optimized by non-negative binomial likelihood, and a stacked heterogeneous ensemble are, respectively, the top ranked classifiers. Our study contributes to the literature by being the first to include such an extensive set of classifiers, performance metrics, and statistical tests in a benchmark study of customer churn.},

However, training models on historical models leads to performance degradation when they are applied to future conditions---a phenomenon known as concept drift. We employ a sliding-window approach that separates the training and testing time windows, creating a future-based ``true test''. Using unique real data, we show that a CatBoost classifier model trained on older data can remain relevant when new, unseen intervals are used. A key innovation of our work is the use of 40-day ``partial churn'' labels; a model trained on these labels accurately predicts 90-day churn by simply adjusting the decision threshold. Out of the six modeled scenarios, in the main realistic scenario, CatBoost retained an accuracy above 0.798 and an F1 of near 0.704, reflecting its robustness even under real-world delays and potential drift. Overall, our findings emphasize that models do not necessarily ``expire'' with time; rather, their performance varies according to when they are tested. This research underscores the importance of a truly future-based evaluation (instead of artificial splits) and offers practical guidance for earlier churn detection when facing real-world data delays.},

Therefore it is essential to efficiently retain gamblers. Churn prediction is a promising new alternative in customer relationship management (CRM) to analyze customer retention. It is the process of identifying gamblers with a high probability to leave the company based on their past behavior. This study investigates whether churn prediction is a valuable option in the CRM palette of the online gambling companies. Using real-life data of poker players at bwin, single algorithms, CART decision trees and generalized additive models are benchmarked to their ensemble counterparts, random forests and GAMens. The results show that churn prediction is a valuable strategy to identify and profile those customers at risk. Furthermore, the performance of the ensembles is more robust and better than the single models.},

We document three phenomena. First, even self-registered consumers with positive savings exhibit inertia. Second, we show that being informed about potential savings has a positive and significant effect on switching. Third, controlling for savings, the effect of incurring overage payments is significant and similar in magnitude to the effect of savings: paying an amount that exceeds the recurrent monthly fee weighs more on the switching decision than being informed that one can save that same amount by switching to a less inclusive plan. We interpret this asymmetric reaction on switching behavior as potential evidence of loss aversion. In other words, when facing complex and recurrent tariff plan choices, consumers care about savings but also seem to be willing to pay upfront fees in order to get ``peace of mind''.},

Therefore, drawing on a sample of 684 residential customers of digital cellular network operators in Germany this study tests hypotheses suggesting that CR, CL, and CS should be treated as differential constructs which are causally inter-linked. LISREL analyses support a two-staged model in which overall CS has a significant impact on CL which in turn influences a customer's intention to terminate/extend the contractual relationship with his mobile cellular network operator (=CR). Mobile service price and personal service benefit perceptions as well as (lack of) number portability between various cellular operators were identified as supply-related variables with the strongest effects on CR. Mobile network operators' perceived customer care performance had no significant impact on CR. The findings suggest that an important lever for regulators to promote competition in cellular markets is the enforcement of efficient number portability procedures between mobile network operators.},

This is the first churn prevention model to utilize this approach. Our main objective is to leverage individual customer lifetime values (CLVs) to ensure that only the most valuable customers are targeted. In contrast, many profit-driven strategies focus on churn probabilities while considering average CLVs, often resulting in significant information loss due to data aggregation. Our proposed model aligns with the principles of the predict-and-optimize framework and can be efficiently solved using stochastic gradient descent methods. Results from 13 churn prediction datasets, sourced from an investment company, underscore the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves the highest average performance in terms of profit compared to other well-established strategies.},

Our results suggest that the kind of contracts held by customers and the concurrence of an external competitor strongly influence customer loyalty right after that cancellation, but those factors become much less significant some months later.

Identifying customers who are likely to make purchases down the line and estimating how much they will spend can help companies create more effective marketing campaigns and special offers that not only boost profits but also improve the overall customer experience and contribute to building lasting relationships. This paper outlines a comprehensive, detailed methodology for the forecasting and analysis of customer behavior using advanced predictive models and machine learning techniques. This framework can assist an organization in making more strategic and data-driven decisions to enhance both performance and profitability while securing improved customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. The primary goal of this research is to increase the accuracy of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) predictions and to provide deeper insights into customer behaviors. To achieve this objective, a combination of four key metrics is employed, namely: predicted purchases estimated using the BG-NBD model, predicted average value calculated through the Gamma-Gamma model, customer clustering labels assigned via the K-means model, and the customer status index derived from the Markov chain model. These essential metrics are subsequently integrated into the dataset. In order to further improve the accuracy of the predictions, this research uses a Stacking Ensemble model that combines four algorithms, i.e., Elastic Net, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. The results demonstrate that integrating those features and using the Stacking Ensemble model substantially increases the prediction accuracy and decreases the errors. Sensitivity analysis and feature importance also prove the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, there is no shortage of options for customers when choosing where to put their money. As a result, customer churn and engagement have become one of the top issues. With the increase in the number of service providers for the same targeted population, there is a need for service providers to try to find the changing customer behaviour and their rising expectations to retain them. Various studies have proposed customer churn. Data mining was routinely used to predict telecom customer attrition. Most researchers have compared and proposed different approaches for the prediction of customer churn, though some of the Machine learning (ML) algorithms used were unable to provide the performance needed to identify customer churn. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) in the Telecommunications Dataset. To prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms, chi-square was used for feature selection to select the most informative features from the original dataset. We validate our model using a ten-fold cross-validation approach to test the performance of our models. RF model performed better than other models in terms of accuracy (94\%), precision (94\%) and F-measure (94\%), respectively. Additionally, we compared our results with existing models that used the same dataset; the proposed strategy outperformed them.

Various algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), probit regression (PR), na\"ive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), were employed to analyze the survey data. The analysis revealed school dropout rate of 12.67\%. Key predictors of dropout included student's grade, age, school type, household income, and type of housing. Logistic regression and probit regression models highlighted age and student's grade as critical predictors, while na\"ive Bayes and random forest models underscored the significance of household income and housing type. Among the models, random forest demonstrated the highest accuracy at 95.00\%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting dropout rates. The findings from this study provide valuable insights for educational policymakers and stakeholders in Somaliland. By identifying and understanding the key factors influencing dropout rates, targeted interventions can be designed to enhance student retention and improve educational outcomes. The dominant role of demographic and educational factors, particularly age and student's grade, underscores the necessity for focused strategies to reduce dropout rates and promote inclusive education in Somaliland.},

  abstract = {This thesis evaluates the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers combined with upsampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN, GNUS) for customer churn prediction in imbalanced datasets. Using datasets with churn ratios of 15\%, 10\%, 5\%, and 1\%, it simulates varying imbalance levels. The models are assessed using metrics such as F1-Score, ROC AUC, PR AUC, MCC, and Cohen's Kappa. By examining datasets with imbalance ratios ranging from moderate to extremely severe, this study addresses a critical research gap. The study offers valuable insights into enhancing predictive accuracy for highly imbalanced datasets while evaluating the behavior and robustness of various models across different levels of data imbalance, with a particular focus on applications within the telecommunications sector. The study found that combining XGBoost with the SMOTE upsampling technique consistently delivers superior predictive performance across all evaluation metrics and levels of class imbalance, including extreme cases like a 1\% churn rate. This combination demonstrated exceptional robustness and maintained high accuracy, making it the most effective strategy identified. In contrast, Random Forest models showed adequate performance only in moderately imbalanced datasets and experienced significant declines under extreme imbalance, regardless of the upsampling method used. The research highlights that while metrics such as ROC AUC and PR AUC remained relatively stable, higher levels of imbalance led to fluctuations in MCC, Kappa, and F1-Scores for most models---except for the XGBoost with SMOTE combination, which consistently maintained high reliability and predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {This article maps considerations of inclusiveness and support for students with disabilities by reviewing articles within the field of learning analytics. The study involved a PRISMA-informed systematic review of two popular digital libraries, namely Clarivate's Web of Science, and Elsevier's Scopus for peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings. A final corpus of 26 articles was analysed. Findings show that although the field of learning analytics emerged in 2011, none of the studies identified here covered topics of inclusiveness in education before the year of 2016. Screening also shows that learning analytics provides great potential to promote inclusiveness in terms of reducing discrimination, increasing retention among disadvantaged students, and validating particular learning designs for marginalised groups. Gaps in this potential are also identified. The article aims to provide valuable insight into what is known about learning analytics and inclusiveness and contribute knowledge to this particular nascent area for researchers and institutional stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to provide a predictive framework of customer churn through six stages for accurate prediction and preventing customer churn in the field of business. Design/methodology/approach The six stages are as follows: first, collection of customer behavioral data and preparation of the data; second, the formation of derived variables and selection of influential variables, using a method of discriminant analysis; third, selection of training and testing data and reviewing their proportion; fourth, the development of prediction models using simple, bagging and boosting versions of supervised machine learning; fifth, comparison of churn prediction models based on different versions of machine-learning methods and selected variables; and sixth, providing appropriate strategies based on the proposed model. Findings According to the results, five variables, the number of items, reception of returned items, the discount, the distribution time and the prize beside the recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) variables (RFMITSDP), were chosen as the best predictor variables. The proposed model with accuracy of 97.92 per cent, in comparison to RFM, had much better performance in churn prediction and among the supervised machine learning methods, artificial neural network (ANN) had the highest accuracy, and decision trees (DT) was the least accurate one. The results show the substantially superiority of boosting versions in prediction compared with simple and bagging models. Research limitations/implications The period of the available data was limited to two years. The research data were limited to only one grocery store whereby it may not be applicable to other industries; therefore, generalizing the results to other business centers should be used with caution. Practical implications Business owners must try to enforce a clear rule to provide a prize for a certain number of purchased items. Of course, the prize can be something other than the purchased item. Business owners must accept the items returned by the customers for any reasons, and the conditions for accepting returned items and the deadline for accepting the returned items must be clearly communicated to the customers. Store owners must consider a discount for a certain amount of purchase from the store. They have to use an exponential rule to increase the discount when the amount of purchase is increased to encourage customers for more purchase. The managers of large stores must try to quickly deliver the ordered items, and they should use equipped and new transporting vehicles and skilled and friendly workforce for delivering the items. It is recommended that the types of services, the rules for prizes, the discount, the rules for accepting the returned items and the method of distributing the items must be prepared and shown in the store for all the customers to see. The special services and reward rules of the store must be communicated to the customers using new media such as social networks. To predict the customer behaviors based on the data, the future researchers should use the boosting method because it increases efficiency and accuracy of prediction. It is recommended that for predicting the customer behaviors, particularly their churning status, the ANN method be used. To extract and select the important and effective variables influencing customer behaviors, the discriminant analysis method can be used which is a very accurate and powerful method for predicting the classes of the customers. Originality/value The current study tries to fill this gap by considering five basic and important variables besides RFM in stores, i.e. prize, discount, accepting returns, delay in distribution and the number of items, so that the business owners can understand the role services such as prizes, discount, distribution and accepting returns play in retraining the customers and preventing them from churning. Another innovation of the current study is the comparison of machine-learning methods with their boosting and bagging versions, especially considering the fact that previous studies do not consider the bagging method. The other reason for the study is the conflicting results regarding the superiority of machine-learning methods in a more accurate prediction of customer behaviors, including churning. For example, some studies introduce ANN (Huang et al., 2010; Hung and Wang, 2004; Keramati et al., 2014; Runge et al., 2014), some introduce support vector machine ( Guo-en and Wei-dong, 2008; Vafeiadis et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011) and some introduce DT (Freund and Schapire, 1996; Qureshi et al., 2013; Umayaparvathi and Iyakutti, 2012) as the best predictor, confusing the users of the results of these studies regarding the best prediction method. The current study identifies the best prediction method specifically in the field of store businesses for researchers and the owners. Moreover, another innovation of the current study is using discriminant analysis for selecting and filtering variables which are important and effective in predicting churners and non-churners, which is not used in previous studies. Therefore, the current study is unique considering the used variables, the method of comparing their accuracy and the method of selecting effective variables.},

Most of the conventional techniques for predicting customer churn require sharing private information about customers.This introduces a significant risk of data leakage and violation of regulations. The study proposes an alternative approach to better predict churning with data privacy based on Federated Learning. In other words, FL lets you directly train machine learning models on source data in different places, one would keep a regional customer database up to date with sensitive customer data, since only model parameters would change and not the raw data itself.The study tells about how to use a Simple NN in a Federated Learning setup, with datasets spread out over three geographical nodes that focus on different types of customers in Mumbai, Ohio, and Ireland. It has batch normalisation for stability and ReLU activation for non-linearity, making it best for predicting churn in a binary way. The FedAvg algorithm will be used to combine the local model changes into a single global model over and over again during the training process.Key performance measures, like F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall, are used to show how well the model works and how close it is to being perfect.},

In the third phase, feature selection is taken into consideration using gravitational search algorithm. Next, the data has been split into two parts train and test set in the ratio of 80\% and 20\% respectively. In the prediction process, most popular predictive models have been applied, namely, logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, etc. on train set as well as boosting and ensemble techniques are applied to see the effect on accuracy of models. In addition, K-fold cross validation has been used over train set for hyperparameter tuning and to prevent overfitting of models. Finally, the obtained results on test set have been evaluated using confusion matrix and AUC curve. It was found that Adaboost and XGboost Classifier gives the highest accuracy of 81.71\% and 80.8\% respectively. The highest AUC score of 84\%, is achieved by both Adaboost and XGBoost Classifiers which outperforms over others.},

Real time customer churn prediction prepares organizations to intervene and since centralized machine learning involves data gathering from sources located in the actual customer environment such a method would be highly invasive of the customer's privacy. This paper aims at proposing a new approach to integrate artificial intelligence technology into real-time customer churn prediction through federated learning where nobody has access to another person's data and the training is done collectively across the devices or organizations. Thus, to provide a solution where public and sensitive data is analyzed while adhering to legal norms like GDPR, FL is used in conjunction with deep learning models. Not only the proposed system can accurately predict the churn rate but also the features or data insights are provided to an AI-based marketing fighting chance repository to engage the customer properly at an opportune time. In the experiment part, by testing on artificially generated customer databases, we prove that our method can obtain satisfactory predictive accuracy and at the same time, avoid leaking individuals' information. Also, there is the evaluation of the effectiveness of the system on marketing with major benefits such as enhanced targeting of campaigns and low customer churn rates. It belongs to the area of privacy-preserving machine learning and intelligent marketing that enables the development of cost-effective and efficient real-time customer churn management resources for data-sensitive industries.},

  abstract = {In present times, data science become popular to support and improve decision-making process. Due to the accessibility of a wide application perspective of data streaming, class imbalance and concept drifting become crucial learning problems. The advent of deep learning (DL) models finds useful for the classification of concept drift in data streaming applications. This paper presents an effective class imbalance with concept drift detection (CIDD) using Adadelta optimizer-based deep neural networks (ADODNN), named CIDD-ADODNN model for the classification of highly imbalanced streaming data. The presented model involves four processes namely preprocessing, class imbalance handling, concept drift detection, and classification. The proposed model uses adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) technique for handling class imbalance data, which utilizes a weighted distribution for diverse minority class examples based on the level of difficulty in learning. Next, a drift detection technique called adaptive sliding window (ADWIN) is employed to detect the existence of the concept drift. Besides, ADODNN model is utilized for the classification processes. For increasing the classifier performance of the DNN model, ADO-based hyperparameter tuning process takes place to determine the optimal parameters of the DNN model. The performance of the presented model is evaluated using three streaming datasets namely intrusion detection (NSL KDDCup) dataset, Spam dataset, and Chess dataset. A detailed comparative results analysis takes place and the simulation results verified the superior performance of the presented model by obtaining a maximum accuracy of 0.9592, 0.9320, and 0.7646 on the applied KDDCup, Spam, and Chess dataset, respectively.},

The Danish telecommunication industry is experiencing a saturated market regarding the number of customers, but the number of service providers has increased significantly in recent years. Due to the high costs of acquiring new customers, the telecommunication industry put great emphasis on retaining customers in such an intensely competitive industry. We employ five machine learning algorithms: random forest, AdaBoost, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting classifier, and decision tree classifier on four datasets from two geographical regions, Denmark and the USA. The first three datasets are from online repositories, and the last one contains responses from 311 students from Aalborg University collected through a survey. We identify key features extracted by the best-performing algorithms based on five performance measures. Based on that, we aggregate all the features that appear important for each dataset. The results demonstrate that customers' preferences are not aligned. Among the prominent drivers, we find that service quality, customer satisfaction, offering subscription plan upgrades, and network coverage are unique to the Danish student population. Telecommunication companies need to integrate the sociohistoric milieu of the Nordic countries to tailor their retention policies to different consumer cultures.},

Effective prediction of potential churners aids in devising robust retention policies and efficient customer management strategies. This study dives into the realm of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis in churn prediction, addressing the inherent challenge posed by diverse and imbalanced customer churn data distributions. This paper introduces a novel approach---the Ratio-based data balancing technique, which addresses data skewness as a pre-processing step, ensuring improved accuracy in predictive modelling. This study fills gaps in existing literature by highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble algorithms and the critical role of data balancing techniques in optimizing churn prediction models. While our research contributes a novel approach, there remain avenues for further exploration. This work evaluates several machine learning algorithms---Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, alongside Ensemble techniques such as Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)---on balanced datasets achieved through our proposed Ratio-based data balancing technique and the commonly used Data Resampling. Results reveal that our proposed Ratio-based data balancing technique notably outperforms traditional Over-Sampling and Under-Sampling methods in churn prediction accuracy. Additionally, using combined algorithms like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost showed better results than using single methods. Our study looked at different aspects like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-Score, finding that these combined methods are better for predicting customer churn. Specifically, when we used a 75:25 ratio with the XGBoost method, we got the most promising results for our analysis which are presented in this work.},

  abstract = {This study examines how imbalanced datasets affect the accuracy of machine learning models, especially in predictive analytics applications such as churn prediction. When datasets are skewed towards the majority class, it can lead to biased model performance, reducing overall effectiveness. To analyze this impact, the research utilizes a churn dataset to evaluate how data imbalance influences model accuracy. The study utilized nine individual classifiers along with six homogeneous ensemble models to evaluate the effects of imbalanced data on model performance. Single classifier models struggle to identify underlying patterns in imbalanced data, while ensembles improve predictive performance by focusing on the minority class. However, when trained on unbalanced data, their accuracy remains subpar. The top six classifiers were selected for further investigation based on their performance on the imbalanced data. A SMOTE sampling technique was employed to create a balanced dataset, ensuring that all classes were adequately represented. The generated model's performance improved from 61 to 79\%, indicating the removal of bias in the target data. The results showed that Adaboost, an optimal classifier, demonstrated superior performance with an F1-Score of 87.6\% in identifying potential churn and assessing customer account health. The findings emphasize the importance of balanced datasets for accurate ML model predictions.},

Despite the significant improvement in machine learning (ML) and predictive analysis efficiency for classification in customer relationship management systems (CRM), their performance remains very limited by heterogeneous data processing, class imbalance, and feature scales. This impact turned out to be more important for simple ML methods which in addition often suffer from over-fitting. This paper proposes a succinct and detailed ML model building process including cross-validation of the combination of SMOTE to balance data and ensemble methods for modelling. From the conducted experiments, the random forest (RF) model yielded the best performance of 0.86 in terms of accuracy and f1-scoreusing balanced data. It confirms the literature summary about this topic which shows that RF was among the most effective algorithms for customer predictive classification issues. The constructed and optimized models were interpreted by Shapley values and feature importance analysis which shows that the ``age'' feature was the most significant while ``HasCrCard'' was the less one. This process has proven effective in bridging previously reported research gaps and the resulting model should be used for supporting bank customer loyalty decision-making.},

Seven linear and non-linear adaptive models are developed using features related to customer dissatisfaction (DSF), customer disloyalty (DLF) and customer churn (CF). Findings of this study suggest that non-linear models are most efficient in predicting customer churn, and both DSF and DLF variables significantly affect the retention strategy. Three groups of customers are discussed in this study in the order of least likelihood of churning to most likelihood. Finally, a priority matrix based on key performance indicators is proposed to help service providers target potential customers to retain.},

  abstract = {In recent times, customer churn has become one of the most significant issues in business-oriented sectors with telecommunication being no exception. Maintaining current customers is particularly valuable due to the high degree of rivalry among telecommunication companies and the costs of acquiring new ones. The early prediction of churned customers may help telecommunication companies to identify the causes of churn and design industrial tactics to address or mitigate the churn problem. Controlling customer churn by developing efficient and reliable customer churn prediction (CCP) solutions is essential to achieving this objective. Findings from existing CCP studies have shown that numerous methods, such as rule-based and machine-learning (ML) mechanisms, have been devised to solve the CCP problem. Nonetheless, the problems of adaptability and the resilience of rule-based CCP solutions are its major weaknesses, and the skewed pattern of churn datasets (class imbalance) is detrimental to the prediction performances of conventional ML models in CCP. Hence, this research developed a robust heterogeneous multi-layer stacking ensemble method (HMSE) for effective CCP. Specifically, in the HMSE method, the prediction prowess of five ML classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Bayesian network (BN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER)) with distinct computational characteristics are ensembled based on stacking and the resulting model is further enhanced using a forest penalizing attribute (FPA) model. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is integrated with the proposed HMSE to balance the skewed class label present in the original experimental datasets. Extensive tests were carried out to determine the effectiveness of the proposed HMSE and S-HMSE on standard telecom CCP datasets. Observed findings from the experimental results showed that HMSE and S-HMSE can effectively predict churners even with the class imbalance (skewed datasets) problem. In addition, comparison studies demonstrated that the suggested S-HMSE offered improved prediction performance and optimum solutions for CCP in the telecom sector in comparison with baseline classifiers, homogeneous ensemble methods, and current CCP approaches.},

  abstract = {Preventing customer churn is an important task for many enterprises and requires customer churn prediction. This paper investigates the effects of interpersonal influence on the accuracy of customer churn predictions and proposes a novel prediction model that is based on interpersonal influence and that combines the propagation process and customers' personalized characters. Our contributions include the following: (1) the effects of interpersonal influence on prediction accuracy are evaluated while including determinants that other researchers proved effective, and several models are constructed based on machine learning and statistical methods and compared, assuring the validity of the evaluation; and (2) a novel prediction model based on interpersonal influence and information propagation is proposed. The dataset used in the empirical study was obtained from a leading mobile telecommunication service provider and contains the traditional and network attributes of over one million customers. The empirical results show that traditional classification models that incorporate interpersonal influence can greatly improve prediction accuracy, and our proposed prediction model outperforms the traditional models.},

  abstract = {Numerous valuable clients can be lost to competitors in the telecommunication industry, leading to profit loss. Thus, understanding the reasons for client churn is vital for telecommunication companies. This study aimed to develop a churn prediction model to predict telecom client churn through customer segmentation. Data were collected from three major Chinese telecom companies, and Fisher discriminant equations and logistic regression analysis were used to build a telecom customer churn prediction model. According to the results, it can be concluded that the telecom customer churn model constructed by regression analysis had higher prediction accuracy (93.94\%) and better results. This study will help telecom companies efficiently predict the possibility of and take targeted measures to avoid customer churn, thereby increasing their profits.},

  abstract = {Churn prediction on imbalanced data is a challenging task. Ensemble solutions exhibit good performance in dealing with class imbalance but fail to improve the profit-oriented goal in churn prediction. This paper attempts to develop a new bagging-based selective ensemble paradigm for profit-oriented churn prediction in class imbalance scenarios. The proposed approach exploits an over-produce and choose strategy, which uses a cost-weighted negative binomial distribution to generate training subsets and a cost-sensitive logistic regression with a lasso penalty to combine base classifiers selectively. Extensive experiments were carried out on ten real-world data sets exhibiting a high level of imbalance from the telecommunication industry. The experimental results show that our proposed method obtains better performance than the other twelve state-of-the-art ensemble solutions for class imbalance in both accuracy-based and profit-based measures. Our research provides a new ensemble tool for imbalanced churn prediction for both academicians and practitioners.},
