The A5 DroppedQuality × HighUsage heatmap shows that this group does **not** have the highest churn; if anything, their churn rate is slightly lower than that of normal/low-usage customers with no recorded issues. Thus, this interaction does not capture a “super-risky” synergy, but it may help GLM and NN model a potential **negative** interaction (engaged but complaining customers may be more likely to stay than silent low-usage customers). For tree-based models, this interaction is left implicit, as trees can learn it directly from DroppedQuality_flag and HighUsage_flag. |",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,none
